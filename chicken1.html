        <h3>Dry Brined Roasted Chicken</h3>
        <p>Dry-brined roasted chickens are the best way to get 
            succulent, juicy meat, and crispy, golden skin! 
            The best part? You only need 5 minutes 
            and some space in the fridge!</p>

            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>1 whole chicken</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons salt, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li> 
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Step 1: Remove chicken from packaging, remove giblet packet from cavity, and pat thoroughly dry with paper towels. Place in a 9x13-inch baking dish.
                    </li>
                <li> Step 2: Mix salt, orange zest, rosemary, and thyme together in a small bowl; rub 3/4 of the mixture all over outside of chicken; rub remaining mixture inside cavity. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate 1 to 3 days.
                    </li>
                <li> Step 3: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove plastic wrap from chicken.
                    </li>
                <li> Step 4: Bake chicken in preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 2 to 2 1/2 hours depending on size. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 20 minutes before carving.
                    </li>
            </ol>
